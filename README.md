# Shrimp Check

Shrimp check is a discord bot in where users can opt in to postrue checks which happen once between 20-160 minutes.

If you want to use the bot localy, in your `.env` make sure you have the following:

```.env
BOT_TOKEN="" # The bot API token
SERVER_ID="" # Your server ID
CHANNEL_ID="" # Your channel you want the bot to send messages in
```

The bot token can be obtained in the discord developer portal under the bot tab.


While the server id is from copying the server's id by right clicking it and clicking `Copy Server ID`. Same for channel id.
